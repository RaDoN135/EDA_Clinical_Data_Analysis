# 🩺 EDA Project – Clinical Data Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** pipeline for clinical datasets, using Python and open-source tools. The analysis aims to clean, explore, and structure the data for future modeling tasks such as disease prediction or survival analysis.

---

## 📌 Key Steps Included:
- ✅ Data profiling and numeric summary (Sweetviz, pandas)
- ✅ Handling missing values (MCAR/MNAR analysis, imputation)
- ✅ Outlier detection (IQR-based, visual)
- ✅ Correlation analysis between variables
- ✅ Distribution comparisons across groups
- ✅ Feature selection using statistical tests (Chi-square, T-test, correlation)
- ✅ Visuals: heatmaps, boxplots, scatterplots
- ✅ Final structured dataset ready for modeling
